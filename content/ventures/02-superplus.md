SuperPlus was built from the ground up by my grandmother, Hyacinth Gloria Chen. It was then carried forward by my uncles, my father, and my aunt. Today I'm at the heart of a couple of the stores day-to-day — operating, advising, and keeping the family legacy alive.

Running a community store in Jamaica is an education in patience, relationships, and resilience. Every shelf stocked, every credit extended to a neighbor who promises to pay Friday — it all adds up to something bigger than commerce. It is trust, built daily.

This is where I learned everything. Retail, margins, community, and how to talk to anyone. SuperPlus isn't just a business — it's where I come from.
