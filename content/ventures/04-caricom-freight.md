Caricom Freight is the family logistics business. Caribbean shipping infrastructure that keeps goods moving across the islands.

This is my father's world — the logistics backbone that supports everything from retail inventory to commercial freight. Being close to this operation gives me a perspective on supply chain and trade that most tech people never get.
