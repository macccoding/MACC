Kemi is an AI product I'm actively building — from concept to code to design to ship. It's born from running multiple businesses and realizing the tools I needed didn't exist, so I'm making them.

Built with Next.js, designed in Figma, and shipping from Mandeville. This is the intersection of everything I care about: technology, design, and solving real problems.

Currently in active development. More to come.
