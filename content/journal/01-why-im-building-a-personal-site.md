### **So… Why a Website?**

Okay.

Yes, I already have Instagram. I have Twitter (f\*ck X). I have LinkedIn. I am online. Trust me.

So why am I building a whole website from scratch like it’s 2009?

Because… none of those actually allow me to tell the full story. How am I supposed to fit all I want to say or describe in a character limited box. Im supposed to illustrate my life with stills and captions.

Don't get me wrong.

They’re cool.

I like them.

I just don’t trust them ***explaining*** my entire personality.

## The Real Reason

I do Istry. I'm deep in the day-to-day at SuperPlus. I shoot with a Sony A7IV, fly a DJI drone, and 3D print things on my BambuLab at 2 AM. I design in Figma. I eat everything.. especially lychee flavored things.

None of that fits in a bio.  And honestly, I was getting tired of introducing myself differently depending on which platform I was on. On Instagram I'm an artsy travel guy. On LinkedIn I'm an entrepreneur. On twitter I'm a tech person.

I'm all of those things. I needed one place where that was obvious.

## Why Build It Myself?

Could I have used Squarespace , Wix, or Wordpress?

Yes.

Would my life be easier?

Also yes.

Did I do it anyway?

Obviously.

I’m a builder. If something can be built, I will probably try to build it. Even if it takes longer. Even if I complain the whole time.

So I built this.

Next.js. Tailwind. Vercel. Not because I’m trying to prove anything.

Mostly because I enjoy suffering slightly in the name of learning.

Also, I made some design choices at 3:30 AM (yawn) that I'm weirdly proud of. This is how I work, everything feeds into everything else.

## What You'll Find Here

Think of this as my corner of the internet. Where I put the stuff that doesn’t fit anywhere else.

Ventures — what I’m actually building (not just the highlight reel).

Journal — what I’m learning, cooking, thinking about.

Gallery — things I’ve seen and liked enough to photograph.

About — me, but not in corporate language.

I’m not trying to be an influencer.

I’m not selling a course.

There’s no “subscribe for secrets.”

A lot of people ask me since I've been home, what do I do?

The answer is: a lot. And now there's a URL for it.
