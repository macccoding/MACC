I grew up eating ackee and saltfish for breakfast and char siu for dinner. That's not a metaphor. That's literally what happened in my house.

Being Jamaican-Chinese means you exist at the intersection of two of the most flavour-obsessed cultures on earth. Scotch bonnet and five spice. Jerk and soy.  Growing up, I didn't think any of this was unusual. It was just food. It was just my family.

It took leaving Jamaica, eating in other countries, and coming back to realise how rare and how special this combination actually is.

## Two Kitchens, One House

The person that was the centre of everything was my Grandma. She could make a pot of brown stew chicken that would feed twenty people and somehow still have leftovers. On the same stove, on the same day, she might be steaming fish (I hate fish but don't tell her that) with ginger and scallion the way she learned how. There was no separation between the two cuisines. It was all just our food.

Sunday dinner was the best example. Rice and peas alongside fried rice. Curry goat next to Pak Jam Gai. Red Stripe and Chinese tea. Nobody thought twice about it. That was the table I grew up at.

## What I Learned Without Realising

Looking back, that kitchen taught me more about food than any restaurant or cookbook ever could. I learned that great food is about technique and patience, not recipes. I learned that seasoning is a verb — you don't follow a measurement, you season until it tastes right. I learned that food is how you show love when you don't have the words for it.

The Jamaican side taught me boldness. Big flavours, no apologies. Scotch bonnet isn't optional. Seasoning isn't subtle. You taste the food and you know someone cared enough to build every layer.

The Chinese side taught me balance. Sweet against salty. Heat against cool. The idea that a dish should have harmony — that every ingredient is there for a reason and nothing is wasted.

Put those two together and you get a way of thinking about food that I haven't found anywhere else in the world.

## How This Shapes Istry

Would the people who taught me to eat — who taught me to care about food — would they reach for a second serving?

If the answer is yes, we make it.

## Jamaica's Chinese Food Culture

Something people outside Jamaica don't know is how deeply Chinese food is embedded in Jamaican culture. Chinese Jamaicans have been here for over 170 years. We're not recent arrivals. The local Chinese restaurant isn't exotic — it's the neighbourhood spot. Every town has one. Everyone has a favourite.

Jamaican-Chinese food is its own thing. It's not mainland Chinese food. It's not Jamaican food. It's something that only exists because two cultures spent generations cooking next to each other, borrowing from each other, and feeding each other. Sweet and sour chicken with fried dumpling. Fried rice with pepper shrimp. Wonton soup with a side of hard dough bread. Leftovers were always interesting. lol.

If you've never had it, you're missing one of the most underrated food cultures in the Caribbean.

## What Food Means to Me

I'm not a chef. I'm not trying to open a restaurant. But food is at the centre of almost everything I do. Istry is a f&b company. SuperPlus is a supermarket. My favourite way to explore a new place is to eat my way through it. Hopefully, getting to the top first and rolling down after.

Food is the thing that connects everything in my life — family, culture, business, travel. It's the one constant. No matter what else changes, the way I think about flavour, about feeding people, about the table being the centre of everything — that comes from growing up at the intersection of Jamaica and China.

And I wouldn't trade that for anything.
