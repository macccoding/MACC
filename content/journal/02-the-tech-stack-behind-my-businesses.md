People always ask me what I do. The real answer is that I bounce between running a food company, operating a family supermarket, building an AI product, and making things — all in the same day. What holds it all together isn't hustle. It's systems.

Here's every tool I use and why.

## The Hardware

Let's start with what I carry and what sits on my desk.

**MacBook** — Everything happens here. Code, design, business ops, writing. I don't have a desktop. I move between locations too much. The laptop is the command center.

**AirPods** — In my ears more hours than not. Calls, music, podcasts, and sometimes just silence from the world while I work.

**Sony A7IV** — My camera. I shoot product photos for Istry, content for social, and personal photography when I have time. Full-frame, versatile, and the autofocus is scary good.

**DJI Drone** — Aerial shots of Jamaica are unreal. I use this for content, for fun, and occasionally for scouting locations. There's something about seeing the island from above that resets your perspective.

**BambuLab 3D Printer** — This is the one that surprises people. I prototype packaging ideas, print custom parts, make gifts, and just experiment. 3D printing is the closest thing to magic I've experienced with technology. You think of something, model it, and hold it in your hand an hour later.

## The Code

I write code. Not as a hobby — as a core part of how I build things.

**iTerm** — My terminal. Everything starts here. Git, npm, SSH, deployments.

**Next.js** — My framework of choice. This website is built on it. Kemi's frontend is built on it. Server components, app router, the whole modern stack. It's fast, it's flexible, and Vercel makes deployment trivial.

**Tailwind CSS** — I can't go back to writing regular CSS. Tailwind lets me design in the browser at the speed of thought. Every project I touch uses it.

**Vercel** — Push to main, it's live. That's the whole pitch and it delivers. I host everything here.

## The Business

Running Istry and being involved in SuperPlus day-to-day means I need business tools that don't get in the way.

**Notion** — My second brain. Meeting notes, project boards, vendor contacts, recipes, content calendars, business plans. If it's not in Notion, it doesn't exist.

**QuickBooks** — Accounting. Invoicing. Tax prep. Not glamorous but essential. When you run multiple businesses, clean books are the difference between knowing what's working and guessing.

**Square POS** — Point of sale at the retail level. It handles transactions, inventory basics, and reporting. Simple, reliable, works in Jamaica.

## The Creative

**Figma** — I design everything here. Brand assets for Istry, UI mockups for Kemi, social media templates, presentation decks. Figma replaced Photoshop, Illustrator, and PowerPoint for me.

**Lightroom** — Photo editing for anything shot on the A7IV. I like the consistency of presets and the nondestructive editing workflow.

## The Philosophy

I don't use tools because they're trendy. I use them because they let me move fast between contexts. In a single day I might be coding a feature for Kemi, designing a label for an Istry product, reviewing inventory numbers at SuperPlus, and editing drone footage from the weekend.

The stack has to support that. Everything needs to talk to everything. Nothing can require a 20-minute setup. If a tool slows me down, it's gone.

The best technology disappears. You don't think about the tool — you think about the work. That's what I optimize for.
