People always ask me what I do. The real answer is that I bounce between a lot things, operating a family business, building software stacks, and making things, usually all in the same day. What holds it all together isn't hustle. It's systems that I've learned to create.

Here's every tool I use and why.

## The Hardware

Let's start with what I carry and what sits on my desk.

**MacBook** — Everything happens here. Code, design, business ops, writing. I don't have a desktop. I move between locations too much. The laptop is the command center.

**AirPods** — In my ears more hours than not. Calls, music, podcasts, and sometimes just silence from the world while I work.

**Sony A7IV** — My camera. I shoot photos for when I travel, content for Sab, and personal photography when I have time. Full-frame, versatile, and the sensor just makes it oh-so-easy.

**DJI Drone** — Aerial shots of Jamaica are unreal. I use this for fun, and occasionally for scouting locations. There's something about seeing the island from above that resets your perspective.

**BambuLab 3D Printer** — This is the one that surprises people. I prototype packaging ideas, print custom parts, make gifts, and just experiment. 3D printing is the closest thing to magic I've experienced with technology. You think of something, model it, and hold it in your hand an hour later.

## The Code

I write code. Not as a job — but as a core part of how I build things.

**iTerm** — My terminal. Everything starts here. Git, npm, SSH, deployments.

**Next.js** — My framework of choice. This website is built on it. Kemi's frontend is built on it. Server components, app router, the whole modern stack. It's fast, it's flexible, and Vercel makes deployment trivial.

**Tailwind CSS** — I can't go back to writing regular CSS. Tailwind lets me design in the browser at the speed of thought. Every project I touch uses it.

**Vercel** — Push to main, it's live. That's the whole pitch and it delivers. I host everything here.

## The Creative

**Figma** — I design everything here. New Ideas, UI mockups for different projects, social media templates, presentation decks. Figma replaced Photoshop, Illustrator, and PowerPoint for me.

**Lightroom** — Photo editing for anything shot on the A7IV. I like the consistency of presets and the nondestructive editing workflow.

**DaVinci** — If you see a video of mine, it's edited here, packaged and delivered with beautiful color grading. Complicated but worth it.

## The Philosophy

Don't use tools because they're trendy. Use them because they let you move fast between contexts. In a single day I might be coding a feature for Kemi, designing a label for an Istry product with Naldo, reviewing inventory numbers at SuperPlus, and editing drone footage from the weekend.

The stack has to support that. Everything needs to talk to everything. Nothing can require a 20-minute setup. It's the only reason I use Apple & Unifi. When you don't need to figure out the ecosystem, you're in **Flow**. That's where you wanna be.

The best technology disappears. You don't think about the tool — you think about the work. That's what I try to optimize for.
